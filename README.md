### Description ###

Many people love books - reading them, buying them, and using them. Our team also love books! According to statistics,
approximately 2.2 billion books are sold worldwide every year. However, this passion for books can come with its own set
of challenges:

1. You have a large collection of books at home that are in good condition. But a lot of space is taken up by books, and
   no one reads them anymore, they just get covered with dust and are useless. It would be great if they were read by
   someone who could appreciate the books at their true worth, we do not want to throw them evey!
2. You want to continue reading, discover new things and new books, but if you read one or two books a month, then in a
   year thatâ€™s 24 new books on the shelf and that costs money!
3. Libraries can be difficult - limited or paid access, short time to read a book, relatively small selection of books,
   or no books in the language you need. And it happens that the library is very far away or it is not in the city at
   all
4. We all understand that the consumer economy is detrimental to our planet. If you want to save the forest and reuse
   already produced things as much as possible, then the BookShare project will also help you with this.

In all of that cases, Book Share could be the solution. The concept is simple: you register on the website and generously share
some of your books with an "Online Library." These books become available to all participants, who can also see your
location down to the postal code. Anyone can request one of your books, and the shipping costs are covered by the
reader. Your responsibility, as a club member, is to take care of the books you have and send the requested book from
the nearest post office to the recipient's address (if provided) or to the post office specified by the recipient.

The website displays all available books for unregistered users, but only registered users who have provided their
details can book a book. You can search for books based on filters such as country, language, genre, and authors. There
are sections for "My Library," where the books you've put up for lending, the ones you want to borrow, or the ones
someone wants to borrow from you are displayed. Additionally, each book has a specific description provided by the user,
including the number of pages, author, title, description, cover photo, and more.

Join Book Share today and be a part of this innovative book-sharing community that promotes sustainable reading and
access to a wide variety of books for everyone.
